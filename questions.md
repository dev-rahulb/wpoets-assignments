# Answers to Technical Questions

## 1. Time Spent & Improvements

I spent around 4 hours on this test.

If I had more time, I would:
- Improve the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) using animations.
- Focus more on design and responsiveness for different devices.
- Use UI libraries to speed up development instead of writing all styles from scratch.
- Add more complete features and polish the application.
- Fix some small bugs and make the code cleaner.

Since I am a full-stack developer, building the full functionality is easy for me, but improving the front-end look and feel takes more time.

## 2. Tracking Performance Issues

To track down performance problems in a live (production) system, I would:
- Check server logs to find any slow responses or errors.
- Use monitoring tools like New Relic, Datadog, or built-in server monitoring.
- Look at database performance â€” check for slow queries and add indexes where needed.
- Analyze frontend performance using browser dev tools to find bottlenecks.
- Review the code and infrastructure for memory leaks or high CPU usage.

Yes, I have worked on fixing performance issues in production before. I used logs and monitoring tools to find the root cause and improved the database queries and server performance.
